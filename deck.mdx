# 3. Web Monetization Spec

</Invert>

---


# [Web Monetization Spec](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0028-web-monetization/)
## * proposed browser API
## * that uses Interledger micropayments
## * to monetize a site

---

# Payment Pointer

```html
<meta name="monetization"
      content="$twitter.xrptipbot.com/html5cat"/>
```

---

# JavaScript API

```JavaScript
document.monetization: EventTarget
document.monetization.state: String
```

state can be 'stopped' | 'pending' | 'started'

<Notes>

These events are dispatched on document.monetization. Web Monetization events MAY be implemented as CustomEvents, or as their own Event class.

</Notes>

# Browser Events

```
monetizationpending
monetizationstart
monetizationstop
monetizationprogress

```
